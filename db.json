This might be due to cinnamon’s cinnamaldehyde levels. This compound is thought to improve blood flow and circulation to hair follicles. Additionally, a 2019 review found that procyanidin — a type of flavonoid found in cinnamon — is associated with hair growth.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Some anecdotal research suggests using cinnamon on the scalp can improve dandruff, thanks to its antifungal properties. But again, we need more research to prove the perks.",

      "body": "First off, cinnamon might help reduce blood sugar levels. Small studies also suggest cinnamon can reduce total plasma glucose and improve insulin sensitivity.\n\nAdditionally, cinnamon might help improve other diabetes-related symptoms. A 2015 review noted that 60 people with type 2 diabetes consumed up to 6 grams (g) of cinnamon a day for 40 days to 4 months. At the end of the study, the 60 participants had lower serum glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol.\n\nKeep in mind that we need more studies on cinnamon tea on its own to show how it can improve diabetes symptoms.",

An older study found that participants lost 0.7 percent of their fat mass and gained 1.1 percent of muscle mass after taking 10 g (or 5 teaspoons) of cinnamon powder every day for three months.\n\nWhile this def sounds promising, more research is needed to show if lower doses of cinnamon — like the amounts found in cinnamon tea — can actually make a difference.",
